If you have reason to\n            believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to RentMinder\n            through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information\n            from our databases.\n          </p>\n          <Heading2 id=\"9-links-to-other-web-sites\">9.
